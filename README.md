The application is developed using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), incorporating technologies such as:

Google Maps API (including Geocoding, Directions, Maps JavaScript, Maps SDK for Android, Places)
Node.js with TypeScript and Express
React Native for the mobile client
User interface components like Lottie, Formik, Yup, Paper, and GiftedChat
